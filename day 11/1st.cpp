// ðŸ’¡ Problem: Validate Credit Card Number Using Luhn Algorithm
// Problem Statement:

// Write a function that checks whether a given credit card number is valid using the Luhn Algorithm.

// The Luhn algorithm works as follows:

// Starting from the right, double every second digit (i.e., digit at positions -2, -4, etc.).

// If the doubled value is greater than 9, subtract 9 from it.

// Sum all the digits (both modified and untouched).

// If the total modulo 10 is 0, the card number is valid
